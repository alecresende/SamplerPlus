The webserver runs from test-site.js using node.js.
So to run the site just type "node test-site.js"

However, you'll need a few packages installed to work with node.js
Specifically "mysql" and "express"
So to install them using the node package manager, type 
"npm install express"
"npm install mysql"

Also you'll need a mysql database running with a db called samples, in which
has a table called Samples with the field

You can use the following command to do so.

CREATE TABLE Samples
(
P_Id int NOT NULL,
Path varchar(255) NOT NULL,
Artist varchar(255),
Title varchar(255),
Tags varchar(255),
PRIMARY KEY (P_Id)
)

So once you do this, you can go into test-site.js and edit in your 
mysql login details to match your mysql info.
